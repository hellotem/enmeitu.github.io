# Welcome to Enmei's homepage!
I am an assistant professor at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering (SEIEE), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I obtained PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China in 2014.
	Thereafter, I worked as a postdoc Research Fellow at [Auckland University of Technology (AUT)](https://www.aut.ac.nz/), New Zealand and [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg), Singapore, from Jan. 2015 to Dec. 2017. I have been a tenure-track assistant professor at SJTU from Jan. 2018.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
