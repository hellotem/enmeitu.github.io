# About death and immortality
If someday human conquered death and becomes immortal, then the human will never be human anymore and the human civilization will cease to develop, even more likely come to its end, i.e. extinguishment. No death, no born. As time is not a matter to worry about, one may spend one thousand years to practice how to write just a letter nicely. Knowledge will cease to grow, just like one cannot alway collect new things but never drops any piece of them. Memories are kept as forever as the person, so hatred would accumulate endlessly. 

So death is part of human. We come here because "we" die.
