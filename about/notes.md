# About death and immortal
If someday human conquered death and becomes immortal, then the human will never be human anymore and the human civilization will cease to develop, even more likely come to its end, i.e. extinguishment. No death, no born. A person may spend one thousand years to practice how to write just a letter nicely. Knowledge will cease to grow, just like you cannot alway collect new things but never drop any of them. Individual memory would never be forgotten, so hatred would accumulate endlessly. 

So death is part of human. We come here because "we" die.
