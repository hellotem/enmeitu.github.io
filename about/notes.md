given $`n ∈ N`$, the set of n × n SPD matrices
is not a subspace of the Euclidean space, but instead has the structure of a Riemannian manifold with
non-positive curvature, usually denoted as Sym++(n). As a consequence, methods for manipulating
elements in Sym++(n) which simply rely on the Euclidean metric are usually suboptimal [19]. This
is quite intuitive, since the Frobenius norm of a matrix difference, kA − BkF , is defined only in
terms of the element-wise difference A − B, without reflecting any structure in A and B.
