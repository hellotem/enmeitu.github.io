## Useful commands and skills for a new Linuxer
Switching from Windows to Linux, especially the command line interaction terminal on a server, is probably a painful experience for most people! But as long as you get familiar with some basic commands and skills, youâ€™ll find that Linux is actually easy to play with and very efficient for productivity in terms of system management and computational extensive model development.
