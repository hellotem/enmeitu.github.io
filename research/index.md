## Research Interests

* Semi-Supervised Learning: manually labeled samples usually are expensive and scarce.  It is economical to train classifiers (shallow or deep models) using a small amount of labeled samples and aboundant unlabeled samples.

* Generic Neural Learning: understanding brain learning mechanism and developing highly effective AI algorithms are a pair of dual problems. It is interesting to explore the underlying learning rules shared between biological and artificial neural networks.
